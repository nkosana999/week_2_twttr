# Just setting up my twttr
This program  prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

## My notes:
This also was one that I did not really find hard to do. However I could use simplified approaches to tracking the occurances of vowels instead of having to hard code each vowels, in both upper and lower case, in my code.
